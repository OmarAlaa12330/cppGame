# Hobby Game Project (Learning C++)

## Overview

This is a hobby game project created as part of my journey to learn C++. The project is in its early stages, and the primary goal is to explore game development while gaining proficiency in the C++ programming language.

## Getting Started

As a work-in-progress hobby project, the game may not be fully functional yet.

## Usage
Since this project is a work in progress and primarily serves as a learning experience, its functionality may be limited. Feel free to explore the code and experiment with it as you learn more about C++ game development.

## Controls
If any controls or interactions are implemented in the game, they will be documented here.

## Contributing
While this project is primarily a personal learning endeavor, I welcome any contributions, suggestions, or feedback from the community. If you have ideas or improvements, please feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
